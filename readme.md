## Config

You Need to config this before use

1. Import ```srilanka.sql``` to your own sql server


2. Update connection values in ```database.py```

```
connection = mysql.connector.connect(
        host="YOUR_DATABSE_HOST",
        port=3306,
        user="YOUR DATABASE USER",
        password="YOUR DATABASE PASSWORD",
        database="YOUR DATABASE"
    )
```

## Usage

1. Run the application:

```bash
python app.py
```

2. Once the application is running, you can access the API endpoints:

- **Get all provinces**: `/provinces`
- **Get all districts**: `/districts`
- **Get all divisions**: `/divisions`
- **Get all districts in a province**: `/getdistricts?province={province_id}`
- **Get all divisions in a district**: `/getdivisons?district={district_id}`

3. Make HTTP GET requests to the desired endpoints using tools like `curl` or `Postman` to retrieve the administrative data.

Example request using `curl`:

```bash
curl http://localhost:5000/provinces
```

Example response:

```json
[
    {
        "id": 1,
        "name": "Western"
    },
    {
        "id": 2,
        "name": "Central"
    },
]
